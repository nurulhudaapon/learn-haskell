# My Haskell Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal Haskell learning repository! This project is designed to guide me through learning Haskell, a powerful and expressive functional programming language. I'll be following the steps below to progress from a beginner to an advanced Haskell programmer.

## Getting Started

1. Install Haskell:

   - Visit [Haskell.org](https://www.haskell.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for my operating system.
   - Ensure I have GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler) and Cabal (Haskell package manager) installed.

2. Set up my development environment:
   - Choose a text editor or IDE with Haskell support (e.g., VSCode with Haskell extension, IntelliJ IDEA with Haskell plugin, or Vim with Haskell plugins).

## Learning Path

### 1. Basics

- [x] Hello World program
- [x] Basic data types (Int, Float, Double, Bool, Char, Function)
- [ ] Lists and tuples
- [ ] Basic functions and function syntax
- [ ] If-then-else expressions
- [ ] Guards
- [ ] Where clauses
- [ ] Let expressions

### 2. Types and Typeclasses

- [ ] Type declarations
- [ ] Type variables
- [ ] Typeclasses (Eq, Ord, Show, Read)
- [ ] Defining custom types
- [ ] Algebraic data types
- [ ] Record syntax

### 3. Functions and Pattern Matching

- [ ] Higher-order functions
- [ ] Partial application and currying
- [ ] Lambda functions
- [ ] Function composition
- [ ] Pattern matching
- [ ] As-patterns
- [ ] Wildcard patterns

### 4. Recursion and List Comprehension

- [ ] Recursive functions
- [ ] List comprehensions
- [ ] Infinite lists

### 5. Modules

- [ ] Creating modules
- [ ] Importing modules
- [ ] Qualified imports
- [ ] Hiding imports

### 6. Input and Output

- [ ] IO actions
- [ ] do notation
- [ ] File I/O
- [ ] Command-line arguments

### 7. Functors, Applicatives, and Monads

- [ ] Functor typeclass
- [ ] Applicative typeclass
- [ ] Monad typeclass
- [ ] Maybe monad
- [ ] List monad
- [ ] State monad

### 8. Error Handling

- [ ] Exceptions
- [ ] Either type
- [ ] Error monad

### 9. Concurrent and Parallel Programming

- [ ] Threads
- [ ] MVars
- [ ] Software Transactional Memory (STM)

### 10. Testing and Debugging

- [ ] QuickCheck
- [ ] HUnit
- [ ] Debugging techniques

### 11. Advanced Topics

- [ ] Lazy evaluation
- [ ] Profiling and optimization
- [ ] Template Haskell
- [ ] Type-level programming
- [ ] Lens library

## Resources

- [Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)
- [Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/)

## Progress Tracking

I'll be updating this README as I progress through my Haskell learning journey. Each completed topic will be marked with an [x] in the checklist above.

## Notes

I'll be adding my personal notes, insights, and code snippets in separate files within this repository as I learn each concept.

## Goals

- [ ] Complete all topics in the learning path
- [ ] Build a small project using Haskell
- [ ] Contribute to an open-source Haskell project
